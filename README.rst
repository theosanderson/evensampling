Status: experimental

This is a package that aims to allow picking of samples from a set of candidates in order to best reflect a known "true" rate of cases in different areas. It attempts to do this within a set of constraints, which might allow only a subset of "boxes" of plates to undergo cherrypicking, and might also limit the number of total samples that could be picked.
